# implment a data strucutre SetOfStacks that creates a new stack when the 
# current stack's threshold is exceeded. 
# SetOfStacks should be composed of several stacks and should create a new stack once the previous one exceeds capacity, 
# SetOfStacks.push() and SetOfStacks.pop()  should behave identically to a single stack. 
# pop() should return the same element it would if this was just one stack




# create, node, LinkedList, Stack and setOfStacks classes
# in setOfStacks class constructor should create  initial stack(linked list), and linkedlist of stack
# linked list of stack. when cur head is a linked list that is full add a new linked list
